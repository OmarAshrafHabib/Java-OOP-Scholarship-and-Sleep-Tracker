# Java OOP: Scholarship Assessment & Sleep Tracker

## Overview
This project contains two Java applications to demonstrate decision statements and `while` loops:
1. **Scholarship Assessment**: Determines a studentâ€™s eligibility and calculates scholarship amounts based on criteria like GPA, credit hours, extra-curricular involvement, and financial need.
2. **Sleep Tracker**: Allows users to enter their optimal sleep time and sleep history, generating a report on sleep patterns including total nights, nights below optimal, lowest sleep time, and average sleep time.

## Features
- **Decision Statements and Input Validation**: Implements decision-making with boolean logic, ensuring all user inputs are valid.
- **While Loops and Sentinel Values**: Uses `while` loops to handle repeated prompts and sentinel values for termination.
- **Console Output**: Clear, user-friendly output for eligibility and sleep report.

## Usage
1. Run `ScholarshipAssessment.java` to determine scholarship eligibility based on user input.
2. Run `SleepTracker.java` to enter sleep data and receive a sleep analysis report.

## Documentation
Each class includes Javadoc comments, providing details on purpose, parameters, and return values.
